The datasets in this package can be used for teaching a variety of skills for crime mapping and other types of crime analysis. 


## Using the datasets in this package

All the datasets in this package come in two formats: first as a conventional R package dataset that can be loaded using the `data()` function from the base package, and secondly as a stand-alone file hosted on GitHub Pages. These stand-alone files are in a variety of different file formats to give students the opportunity to learn how to load files of different types. In most cases the contents of the two versions of the dataset are identical, but where they differ that is noted below.

If you only want to teach students about manipulating existing data, you can get students to install the crimemappingdata package from GitHub and load the data using the `data()` function from the base package. However, loading data is an important part of any analytical workflow, and one students frequently trip up over. For that reason I suggest loading the datasets from the stand-alone file URL listed on the help page (included in the package itself and on the package website) associated with each dataset. This will be particularly useful for students for datasets that must be separately downloaded and/or unzipped before being loaded, since this gives students practice in interacting with the file system, creating temporary files, etc.


## Spatial datasets: point-level data


### `aggravated_assaults`

```{r}
data(aggravated_assaults, package = "crimemappingdata")
```

Dataset of `r format(nrow(aggravated_assaults), big.mark = ",")` aggravated assaults in Austin, TX, in 2019.

```{r}
aggravated_assaults |> 
  head(10) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

The stand-alone version of this dataset is different from the package version. The stand-alone version is an Excel file containing three sheets. Each sheet has aggravated-assault data for 2019 for a different city: Austin, TX; Fort Worth, TX; and Seattle, WA. Students can get the same data as is in the package version of the dataset by loading the `Austin` sheet from the Excel file using the [readxl package](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/).


### `bronx_shootings` and `nyc_shootings`

```{r}
data(bronx_shootings, package = "crimemappingdata")
data(nyc_shootings, package = "crimemappingdata")

downtown_homicides_table$label <- gsub(
  "\n", 
  "<br>", 
  downtown_homicides_table$label
)
downtown_homicides_table |> 
  head(10) |> 
  knitr::kable(caption = "`downtown_homicides`")
```

```{r}
glenrose_heights_homicides_table <- glenrose_heights_homicides
glenrose_heights_homicides_table$label <- gsub(
  "\n", 
  "<br>", 
  glenrose_heights_homicides_table$label
)
glenrose_heights_homicides_table |>
